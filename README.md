# Tab Switcher Chrome Extension

Tab Switcher is a simple Chrome extension that allows you to easily switch between the last two active tabs using a customizable keyboard shortcut.

## Features

- Switch between the last two active tabs with a keyboard shortcut.
- Customizable keyboard shortcut to fit your preferences.

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open Google Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`.
3. Enable "Developer mode" by toggling the switch at the top right corner.
4. Click on the "Load unpacked" button.
5. Select the directory where you cloned or downloaded the extension.

## Usage

After installing the extension, you can use the following keyboard shortcut to switch between the last two active tabs:

- **Ctrl+Shift+Right**: Switch to the second-to-last active tab.

## How It Works

This extension keeps track of the last two active tabs and provides a command to switch to the second-to-last active tab.

The extension's background script (`background.js`) handles the tab tracking and command execution. The script listens for tab activation events and updates the list of last active tabs accordingly. When the custom keyboard shortcut is triggered, the extension checks if there are at least two tabs in the history and switches to the second-to-last active tab.

```javascript
// Keep track of the last two active tabs
var lastActiveTabs = [];

chrome.tabs.onActivated.addListener(function(activeInfo) {
  // ... (code to update lastActiveTabs)
});

chrome.commands.onCommand.addListener(function(command) {
  if (command === "switch-last") {
    // ... (code to switch to second-to-last tab)
  }
});
```
